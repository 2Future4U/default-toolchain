template.description: "After you click **Deploy**, your app will be deployed to Bluemix.\n\nYour app's code will be automatically loaded into a Git repo. Each time you commit changes to the repo, they are automatically deployed by using a toolchain that isassociated with your app. You can add more tools to the toolchain and share it with your team. [Learn more](https://bluemix.net/devops/getting-started).\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Deploy**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).~otc-ui628"
