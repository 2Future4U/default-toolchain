template.description: |
  Your app will be enabled for Continuous Delivery by using this toolchain. The toolchain
  includes a clone of your Git repo, a pipeline for building and deploying code changes,
  a Web IDE for editing code on the cloud, and an issue tracker. After you create the
  toolchain, you can configure it and add more tools to it.~otc-ui550
  [Learn more](https://bluemix.net/devops/getting-started).~otc-ui551
  This toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).~otc-ui552
  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https://hub.jazz.net/deploy?legacy&repository={[{repository}]}),~otc-ui553
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.
