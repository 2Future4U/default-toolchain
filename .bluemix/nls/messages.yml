template.name: "Deploy the {{baseName}} App to Bluemix"
template.description: |
  ## To see the application running on Bluemix, push the **Create** button.

  This creates a toolchain that contains the tools to deploy the app and takes
  you to a page that describes them. You can watch the app being deployed by
  clicking on the pipeline tile on that page. When the pipeline completes, you
  can click on the **View app** button to see it running.

  ### Configuration Options
  Before you push the **Create** button, you can change the name of the toolchain
  that will be created by editing the Toolchain Name field on this page. By default
  this also updates the name of the repository that is created, and the name of
  the application on Bluemix.

  You can also click on the Git tile to configure the name of the repository, or
  the Pipeline tile to change the name of the app and to set where it will be
  deployed in Bluemix (region/org/space).

  *Note: This toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the
  [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).*

  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https://hub.jazz.net/deploy?repository={{repository}}),
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.
toolchain.getting_started: >-
  This is the toolchain for your application. You can watch the pipeline deploy it
  by clicking on the **Delivery Pipeline** tile below. Once the application is deployed,
  you can click on the **View app** button to see it running.
